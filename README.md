# Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nano-Degree Project 5 "Neighborhood" Map

## Project is to explore Chicago area from my life.

The application uses the Google Maps API, Wikipedia API and Knockout JS JavaScript library to help a user explore several "points of interest" around Chicago.

If You can click on a given _pin_ to get an _infowindow_ which will display a link to a Wikipedia article along with the Street View (Google Maps API) of the specific site.

If you like you can use the list at top left to go directly to the _pin_ and _infowwindow_ you would like. And last of of all you can type in a name or portions of a name into the _search_ box to filter the list.

## Running instructions:
* Use the list at top left to go directly to the point of interest. This will highlight (turn red point "blue") the specific pin along with a popup window with links to Wikipedia and a Google Street View photo. 
* You can also click directly on any pin on the map to do the same thing as clicking on the list item. 
* Additionally, you can sue the _search_ box to filter the points of interest.
